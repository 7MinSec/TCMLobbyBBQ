## What is this?
This tool is for PC players of the [Texas Chain Saw Massacre](https://www.txchainsawgame.com/) game to help them get into lobby queues more efficiently.  

## Whoa whoa whoa stop right there pal - is this a cheat?
No!  It's not a cheat.  It is a tool that regularly monitors what's on your TCM screen, 

Because if you're a fan of the game, you know one or more of the following can happen to you:

* You wait for several minutes to get placed into a match, but never do
* You're waiting for players in a lobby for way too many minutes, only to have the match fail to start
* You're having a blast playing the game when suddenly you're kicked out due to ping time problems, "idle" false positives, etc.
